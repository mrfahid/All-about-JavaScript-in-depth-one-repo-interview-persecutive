## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers the web. From interactive websites to server-side applications, JavaScript plays a crucial role. In this guide, weâ€™ll explore its various aspects, step by step.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the details, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any other of your choice)
- Node.js installed (for running JavaScript outside the browser)

## Core Concepts

1. **Variables and Data Types:** Learn how to declare variables, work with strings, numbers, booleans, and other data types.

2. **Control Flow:** Explore conditionals (if statements, switch cases), loops (for, while), and error handling (try-catch).

3. **Functions:** Master function declarations, arrow functions, and higher-order functions.

4. **Objects and Classes:** Understand object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript.

5. **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Dive into promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations.

## Real-World Examples

In this section, Iâ€™ve provided practical examples of JavaScript usage. From building a simple to-do list app to creating interactive forms, youâ€™ll find code snippets and explanations.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

Prepare for technical interviews! Iâ€™ve included common DSA questions along with solutions. Practice these to enhance your problem-solving skills.
